/*
 * Programming Quiz - Navigating the Food Chain (3-8)
 *
 * Use a series of ternary operator to set the category to one of the following:
 *   - "herbivore" if an animal eats plants
 *   - "carnivore" if an animal eats animals
 *   - "omnivore" if an animal eats plants and animals
 *   - undefined if an animal doesn't eat plants or animals
 *
 * Notes
 *   - use the variables `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` in your ternary expressions
 *   - `if` statements aren't allowed ;-)
 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have the variables `eatsPlants`, `eatsAnimals`
 * - Your code should include ternary statements. Do not use if....else statement. 
 * - Your code should produce the expected output
 * - Your code should not be empty
 * - BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE PUNCTUATION AND THE EXACT WORDS TO BE PRINTED.
 */
 
// change the values of `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` to test your code
var eatsPlants = true;
var eatsAnimals = false;



/*
 * Test your code agaist the followig possible input/output combinations of (`eatsPlants`, `eatsAnimals`, expected output):
 * - (true, true, omnivore)
 * - (false, true, carnivore)
 * - (true, false, herbivore)
 * - (false, false, undefined)

A switch statement is another way to chain multiple else if statements that are based on the same value without using conditional statements. Instead, you just switch which piece of code is executed based on a value.
